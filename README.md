Incentive Scheduler Algorithm for Cooperation and Coverage Extension in Wireless Networks




Introduction


The aim of the project is to extend the coverage area of a wireless network without increasing the infrastructure. To achieve this, we need to help border mobiles relay packets to users out of the coverage area. There already had been research done to solve this problem. The objective is to guarantee a High Quality of Services (QoS). One of the existing projects solves this problem by optimising the number of hops between relayed nodes. But this method does not take into account that the node moves in reality. Another method is to increase the throughput of the antenna. Relayed nodes share their throughput with neighbours out of the coverage area. But relayed nodes have a decreased QoS. To solve the problem, one needs to modify the scheduling algorithm of the access point to find a better solution.
The idea of the project is to solve the problem by increasing the priorities of relayed nodes and reward their help. Relayed nodes can choose if they want to cooperate. They will be rewarded regarding the percentage of cooperation. This solution is called Coverage Extension based on Incentive scheduling (CEI).
